A site for aspiring slactuaries.

this site is gonna be my attempt to write up all my notes and knowledge from
an actuarial degree and some exams into a slick site.

## features

* go http server

* templating engine

## TODO

- [ ] type up notes into markdown

- [ ] set up proper notes filesystem and query abilities (no sql though)

- [ ] make md -> html with native go solution

- [ ] set up KaTeX for equation rendering

- [ ] user login and track progress (probably sql)

- [ ] cool ui
